# Task Manager

This is a simple Task Manager application that allows users to add, delete, and filter tasks based on their completion status and priority levels. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The task manager is able to store your tasks in localStorage.

## Features

*   **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks with a specified priority level.
*   **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list.
*   **Mark as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed.
*   **Filter Tasks:** Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (all, completed, uncompleted) and priority level (all, low, medium, high).
*   **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in the local storage, so they persist even after the browser is closed.
